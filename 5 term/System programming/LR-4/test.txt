Elon Musk has scrapped Twitter’s working from home policy and ordered its staff back to 
the office just days after firing 3,700 employees.

The social media platform’s new owner told staff in an email, seen by the Guardian, 
that its “road ahead is arduous and will require intense work to succeed”.

The Tesla CEO added that working from home would no longer be allowed except in 
special circumstances, with such cases personally vetted by Musk.

“Remote work is no longer allowed, unless you have a specific exception. Managers 
will send the exception lists to me for review and approval,” Musk wrote.

He added that the new policy, first reported by Bloomberg, would be effective from 
Thursday for a minimum of 40 hours a week.

Musk fired about half of the company’s 7,500-strong workforce last Friday, having 
bought it for $44bn (£38.7bn) the previous week. At the same time, he said Twitter 
had been hit by a pause in spending from advertisers that had caused “a massive drop 
in revenue”. Twitter makes most of its more than $5bn in annual revenue from advertising.

The company has begun rolling out Twitter Blue, its new subscription service, in 
the UK. Users who pay £6.99 a month get a blue tick next to their username, as well as 
early access to forthcoming features like bookmark folders and the ability to change 
the colour of the app icon. Musk is hoping that Twitter Blue will reduce the company’s 
reliance on advertising.

Despite the chief executive’s promise last week that the international pricing of Blue 
would be adjusted “proportionate to purchasing power parity”, an economic measure of 
exchange rates that takes into account the cost of living in various countries, Musk 
seems to have given ground to Apple. The subscription service is billed through Apple’s 
in-app purchases, which locked Twitter in to charging £6.99 in the UK to match the 
$7.99 in the US.

Musk also tried to reassure advertisers about his plans for the company in a meeting 
on Twitter’s audio chat feature, Spaces, on Wednesday.

Big brands including General Motors, United Airlines, the cereal maker General Mills 
and others have paused buying ads on Twitter as they watch whether Musk‘s historic 
comments that he is a “free speech absolutist” will lead to a rise in hate speech and 
divisive content on the platform.
